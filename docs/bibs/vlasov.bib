abstract = {An approach is proposed to improve the efficiency of fourth-order algorithms for numerical integration of the equations of motion in molecular dynamics simulations. The approach is based on an extension of the decomposition scheme by introducing extra evolution subpropagators. The extended set of parameters of the integration is then determined by reducing the norm of truncation terms to a minimum. In such a way, we derive new explicit symplectic Forest-Ruth- and Suzuki-like integrators and present them in time-reversible velocity and position forms. It is proven that these optimized integrators lead to the best accuracy in the calculations at the same computational cost among all possible algorithms of the fourth order from a given decomposition class. It is shown also that the Forest-Ruth-like algorithms, which are based on direct decomposition of exponential propagators, provide better optimization than their Suzuki-like counterparts which represent compositions of second-order schemes. In particular, using our optimized Forest-Ruth-like algorithms allows us to increase the efficiency of the computations by more than ten times with respect to that of the original integrator by Forest and Ruth, and by approximately five times with respect to Suzuki's approach. The theoretical predictions are confirmed in molecular dynamics simulations of a Lennard-Jones fluid. A special case of the optimization of the proposed Forest-Ruth-like algorithms to celestial mechanics simulations is considered as well. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {A brief summary is given of the early studies of Landau damping, followed by a discussion of the issues of singularities in the distribution function, reversibility and nonlinear constraints. A difference is emphasized between the evolution of a single-scale localized Langmuir perturbation and a long quasimonochromatic wavetrain. Applicability conditions of the quasilinear approximation are discussed. Examples of the use of the concept of Landau damping in hydrodynamics, astrophysics and other systems are presented.},

@article{Cheng1976,
abstract = {A convenient, fast, and accurate method of solving the one-dimensional Vlasov equation numerically in configuration space is described. It treats the convective terms in the x and v directions separately and produces a scheme of second order in $\Delta$t. The resulting free-streaming and accelerating equations are computed with Fourier interpolation and spline interpolation methods respectively. The numerical method is tested witth linear and nonlinear problems. The method is very accurate and efficient. A new method of smoothing the distribution function is given. It reduces the computational effort by artificially increasing the entropy of the system. As a result, the distribution function is smooth enough to be well represented on a given mesh. The methods can be generalized in a straightforward way to deal with more complicated cases such as problems with nonperiodic spatial boundary conditions, two- and three-dimensional problems with and without external magnetic and/or electric fields. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

@article{Casas2017,
abstract = {We consider the Vlasov–Poisson equation in a Hamiltonian framework and derive new time splitting methods based on the decomposition of the Hamiltonian functional between the kinetic and electric energy. Assuming smoothness of the solutions, we study the order conditions of such methods. It appears that these conditions are of Runge–Kutta–Nystr{\"{o}}m type. In the one dimensional case, the order conditions can be further simplified, and efficient methods of order 6 with a reduced number of stages can be constructed. In the general case, high-order methods can also be constructed using explicit computations of commutators. Numerical results are performed and show the benefit of using high-order splitting schemes in that context. Complete and self-contained proofs of convergence results and rigorous error estimates are also given.},
