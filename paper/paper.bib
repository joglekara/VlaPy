abstract = {A model Fokker-Planck equation for a single species of particles in a plasma is discussed. This equation has several properties in common with the real equation, and ascribes an approximately correct behavior to most of the particles, though incorrect for the high-energy tail in the thermal distribution. It is shown that the equation can be solved completely, for the small perturbations of a uniform plasma by electric fields harmonic in space and time, in an external magnetic field. Applications to ionospheric radar scattering are briefly discussed; it is shown that in certain circumstances, ion-ion collisions can have a profound effect on the scattering even though the collision frequency is much smaller than the ion gyrofrequency, and this appears to agree with observation.},

@article{Omelyan2002,
abstract = {An approach is proposed to improve the efficiency of fourth-order algorithms for numerical integration of the equations of motion in molecular dynamics simulations. The approach is based on an extension of the decomposition scheme by introducing extra evolution subpropagators. The extended set of parameters of the integration is then determined by reducing the norm of truncation terms to a minimum. In such a way, we derive new explicit symplectic Forest-Ruth- and Suzuki-like integrators and present them in time-reversible velocity and position forms. It is proven that these optimized integrators lead to the best accuracy in the calculations at the same computational cost among all possible algorithms of the fourth order from a given decomposition class. It is shown also that the Forest-Ruth-like algorithms, which are based on direct decomposition of exponential propagators, provide better optimization than their Suzuki-like counterparts which represent compositions of second-order schemes. In particular, using our optimized Forest-Ruth-like algorithms allows us to increase the efficiency of the computations by more than ten times with respect to that of the original integrator by Forest and Ruth, and by approximately five times with respect to Suzuki's approach. The theoretical predictions are confirmed in molecular dynamics simulations of a Lennard-Jones fluid. A special case of the optimization of the proposed Forest-Ruth-like algorithms to celestial mechanics simulations is considered as well. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The description of the individual phenomena and of the nonlinear coupling between them involves a hierarchy of models, which, when applied to realistic configurations, require the most advanced numerical techniques and algorithms and the use of state-of-the-art high-performance computers. The common thread of such models resides in the fact that the plasma components are at the same time sources of electromagnetic fields, via the charge and current densities that they generate, and subject to the action of electromagnetic fields. This leads to a wide variety of plasma modes of oscillations that resonate with the particle or fluid motion and makes the plasma dynamics much richer than that of conventional, neutral fluids.},

abstract = {Our modern society requires environmentally friendly solutions for energy production. Energy can be released not only from the fission of heavy nuclei but also from the fusion of light nuclei. Nuclear fusion is an important option for a clean and safe solution for our long-term energy needs. The extremely high temperatures required for the fusion reaction are routinely realized in several magnetic-fusion machines. Since the early 1990s, up to 16 MW of fusion power has been released in pulses of a few seconds, corresponding to a power multiplication close to break-even. Our understanding of the very complex behaviour of a magnetized plasma at temperatures between 150 and 200 million C surrounded by cold walls has also advanced substantially. This steady progress has resulted in the construction of ITER, a fusion device with a planned fusion power output of 500 MW in pulses of 400 s. ITER should provide answers to remaining important questions on the integration of physics and technology, through a full-size demonstration of a tenfold power multiplication, and on nuclear safety aspects. Here we review the basic physics underlying magnetic fusion: past achievements, present efforts and the prospects for future production of electrical energy. We also discuss questions related to the safety, waste management and decommissioning of a future fusion power plant.},

abstract = {Collisional effects can play an essential role in the dynamics of plasma waves by setting a minimum damping rate and by interfering with wave-particle resonances. Kinetic simulations of the effects of electron-ion pitch angle scattering on Electron Plasma Waves (EPWs) are presented here. In particular, the effects of such collisions on the frequency and damping of small-amplitude EPWs for a range of collision rates and wave phase velocities are computed and compared with theory. Both the Vlasov simulations and linear kinetic theory find the direct contribution of electron-ion collisions to wave damping is about a factor of two smaller than is obtained from linearized fluid theory. To our knowledge, this simple result has not been published before. Simulations have been carried out using a grid-based (Vlasov) approach, based on a high-order conservative finite difference method for discretizing the Fokker-Planck equation describing the evolution of the electron distribution function. Details of the implementation of the collision operator within this framework are presented. Such a grid-based approach, which is not subject to numerical noise, is of particular interest for the accurate measurements of the wave damping rates.},

We investigate how this integral transform interacts with the Fokker-Planck collision operator. The commutator of this collision operator with the G-transform (the “shielding term”) is shown to be negligible. We exactly solve the advection-diffusion equation without the shielding term. This solution determines when collisions dominate and when advection (i.e., Landau damping) dominates. This integral transform can also be used to simplify gyro-/drift-kinetic equations. We present new gyrofluid equations formed by taking moments of the G-transformed equation. Since many gyro-/drift-kinetic codes use Hermite polynomials as base elements, we include an explicit calculation of their G-transform.},

Here, we present the application of a field-particle correlation technique to directly measure the transfer of energy between the turbulent electromagnetic field and electrons in the Earth's magnetosheath, the region of solar wind downstream of the Earth's bow shock. The measurement of the secular energy transfer from the parallel electric field as a function of electron velocity shows a signature consistent with Landau damping. This signature is coherent over time, close to the predicted resonant velocity, similar to that seen in kinetic Alfven turbulence simulations, and disappears under phase randomisation. This suggests that electron Landau damping could play a significant role in turbulent plasma heating, and that the technique is a valuable tool for determining the particle energisation processes operating in space and astrophysical plasmas},

The numerical method is tested witth linear and nonlinear problems. The method is very accurate and efficient. A new method of smoothing the distribution function is given. It reduces the computational effort by artificially increasing the entropy of the system. As a result, the distribution function is smooth enough to be well represented on a given mesh.

Here we show how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring, and analyzing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the entire scientific Python universe is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects.
